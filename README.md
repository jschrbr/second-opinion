> Remembering what you like can be hard, second-opinion is a simple application that can be easily trained to tell you if you like what your camera is pointed at.

### 🏠 [Homepage](https://github.com/jschrbr/second-opinion)

### ✨ [Demo](https://jschrbr.github.io/second-opinion/)

## Usage

> Just open the app, point the camera at something you like or dont like and hold down the appropriate button. The application will begin to learn your likes and dislikes, and constantly predict whether you like what it sees. All training and data sets remains on the device, and your custom trained classifier is kept in `localStorage`.
